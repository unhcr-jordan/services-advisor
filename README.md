# Building

This build uses npm, gulp, and browserify to manage dependencies.

To install gulp:

- run `npm install -g gulp`

To build the js/css:

- run `npm install` to download the 3rd party libs in `package.json`
- during development:
    - run `gulp` in the background, i.e. run `gulp` in a terminal and leave it running. It will automatically recompile
      `js/app.js` and `css.main.css` files as you edit the src files.
- when preparing for production:
    - run `gulp dist` to create minified `js.app.js` and `css/main.css` files.

To run the project:
- run `npm install -g http-server`
- run `http-server`
- go to `http://localhost:8080`
- in the future, since you've already installed http-server you can just run `http-server`

# How Services Data Is Loaded and Translated

- `cd service-list-retrieval`
- `cat sources.txt | node getJSON.js`
  - this will call all the urls in `sources.txt` and then concatenate all the json responses into `services.json`
- `node LoadJSON.js`
  - this takes the json from `services.json` and removes all the `comments` fields (which aren't translated) to output `js/services_EN.json`
- `node ParseEn_AR_JSON.js`
  - uses `data.csv` to regex replace the English strings in `js/services_EN.json` with their Arabic translations. This outputs `js/services_AR.json`.

## Arabic Site (http://data.unhcr.org/jordan/services-advisor/index_AR.html)

- uses a modified `index.html` with Arabic translations
- this in turn requires `app_AR.js` instead of `app.js`
- `app_AR.js` loads `compiled_AR.json`
